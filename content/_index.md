      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I am a Ph.D. student in **Biomedical Informatics and Data Science** at Arizona State University, working under **Prof. Irbaz Riaz** (ASU/Mayo Clinic) and **Prof. Li Liu**. My research focuses on developing **AI systems for oncology**, particularly in applying large language models and generative AI to improve clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

        Currently at **Mayo Clinic**, I'm developing:
        - **LLM + rule-based systems** for hematology oncology clinical decision support
        - **Automated pipelines** to identify major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in clinical notes
        - **Explainable AI** approaches for healthcare applications

        I'm passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI technologies and critical healthcare applications through explainable and privacy-preserving machine learning. I also write about AI research on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ganadilynaif).
