abstract: An end-to-end Generative AI system pipeline to detect Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) outcomes in clinical notes, specifically for Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) patient records. This work leverages Large Language Models to automatically identify and extract MACE events from unstructured clinical text.
