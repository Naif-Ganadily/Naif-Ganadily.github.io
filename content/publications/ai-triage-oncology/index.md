**Status: Pending Publication**

This research develops a hybrid AI system that combines Generative AI with rule-based approaches to automate and enhance the triage process in hematology oncology. The system aims to maintain the rigor and safety standards of traditional medical protocols while providing faster decision support to clinicians.

**Key Contributions:**
- End-to-end automated triage pipeline for hematology oncology
- Integration of LLM reasoning with established clinical rules
- Designed to assist rather than replace clinical expertise

**Affiliation:** Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale Campus & Arizona State University
